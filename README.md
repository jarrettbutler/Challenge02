# Portfolio

## Description

This website is my beginner portfolio to show off my development skills to potential employers or cutomers. It is very important to have a good portofilio as it is the first impression you put on a potential client. 9/10 they will probably decide if they will hire you or not based off the portfolio. This is something very basic that I can use going forward with my career but also easy enough that it can be done on the second week. The thing I leanrt about the most is that CSS can be a huge pain and it is very maticulous.
